    "text": "Question: How well-liked is classical music today?\n\nDataSet. Source: Kaggle\nIntroduction: Why is this important?\nPercentage Audience for Music Genre\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average percentage of audience remains constant at 1% across many different years from 2017 to 2021. This is an intriguing fact - that it is a low percentage and a steady, unchanging percentage striked me as curious. I wondered if this percentage is still reflective of today, and if the popularity of classical music would change in the future. Some argue that classical music is timeless and will continue to stand the test of time - just like it has currently. On the contrary, some argue that classical music is “dying” because of the following factors:\n#1 Realistically, less and less people listen each year per capita and even opera houses are kept open by public funding and private donations instead of sales. With lack of sufficient support from governments and lowered interest, it seems inevitable that classical music will fall out of favor.\n#2 Classical music is no longer the same genre as it was - currently it is only comprised and recognised for pieces by the most prominent, superstar composers like Beethoven. There are still classical pieces made currently, but these pieces often go unnoticed and receive no recognition.\n#3 Classical music competes head-on with modern music - which is evolving and changing all the time. Furthermore, as music becomes more experimentally and its form expands, it appears that current popular music could not deviate further from classical music.\nPopularity of Music Over Time\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Types Of Classical Music Is Well-liked?\n#1. Energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanceability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassical Music In The Future\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in the graphs above, the high r-value of 0.771 suggests that average popularity rating and years have a strong positive linear correlation. Hence, it is appropriate to use this dataset to create a prediction model that can reflect the popularity rating of the dataset in the following years.\n \nLimitations\n#1 Reliability of Datasets While the dataset I used can be used to predict the popularity of classical music in the future. It is still ultimately a dataset made for years that are outside of the data range of the original dataset. This affects the reliability of the data and the conclusions that I have made. The graph below shows the extent to which the linear regression model I have made is valid as the shaded area visualises its confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n#2 Classical Music Is Constantly Evolving\nThe dataset I have tided for analysis is from an larger dataset. My decision to pick out only the most prominent classical composers and musicians narrows the scope to which the findings from this analysis can apply to. Therefore, it may not be sufficient to reflect the genre of “classical music”. Additionally, music classified under classical music is constantly evolving and changing over time. Hence, it would be very easy for the observations made and the dataset gathered to become obselete.\nConclusions"

This original dataset was retrieved from Spotify platform using the Python library “Spotipy”. This allows users to access music data provided via APIs. The larger dataset collected also includes 19 features, a total of 61,445 unique artists and 82 genres in the data.\nFeatures/Variables of Dataset\n\nPopularity refers to the popularity of the track by the public. The popularity rating ranges from 0 to 100.\nYear refers to the release year of the track.\nEnergy refers to the level of intensity and activity of the piece (from 0 to 1).\nDanceability refers to the level of liveliness of the piece (from 0 to 1).\nValence refers to the level of music positivity. This means that pieces with higher valence are usually more upbeat and happy, while pieces with lower valence are usually sadder and slower.\nName refers to the name of the piece.\nArtists refers to the artist of the piece."
